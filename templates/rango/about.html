<!--
Difference between javascript and jquery.
This is assigning the function alert() to the onClick handler of the button.
-->
<!-- 	<button onClick="alert('You clicked the button using Javascript.');">
		Click Me - I run Javascript
	</button>
	<br /> -->

<!--
currently no javascript code associated with the button. Its code is in rango-jquery.js

The JQuery/Javascript code here, first selects the document object, and when it is ready, it executes the functions within its body, i.e. $("#about-btn").click(), which selects the element in the page with id equal to about-btn, and then it programatically assigns to the on click event, the alert() function.
-->
	<button id="about-btn"> Click Me - I'm Javascript on Speed</button>

	<p>This is a example</p>

	<!--
		It is also possible to access the 
		html of a particular element.
		On click of the element with id 
		#about-btn, we first get the html 
		inside the element with id msg and 
		appeand “o” to it. Then we change 
		the html inside the element by 
		calling the html function again, 
		but this time passing through string 
		msgstr to replace the html inside 
		that element.

		Hello

<!--
	load static tag above allows to access
	static media which allows using the static
	template lag below.

	In this example, the static tag will combine the STATIC_URL with "rango.jpg" so that the rendered HTML looks like the following.
	< img src="/static/images/rango.jpg" alt="Picture of Rango" / > 
	-->
        <img src="{% static "images/puppy.jpg" %}" alt="Picture of Puppy" />
    </div>
