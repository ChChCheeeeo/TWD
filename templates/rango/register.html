        You should be aware of the enctype attribute for the <form> element. When you want users to upload files from a form, itâ€™s an absolute must to set enctype to multipart/form-data. This attribute and value combination instructs your browser to send form data in a special way back to the server. Essentially, the data representing your file is split into a series of chunks and sent. You should also should remember to include the CSRF token, too. Ensure that you include { % csrf_token % } within your <form> element.
